The following are some headings that you should consider using if your output is a case study or similar:

**Background -
Give brief details of institution, type of learners and learning environment in which the activity/ies took place**

**Intended outcome(s) -
Describe the objective(s) behind the practice outlined here**

**The challenge -
Identify the issues that required attention or which prompted you to re-assess your previous practice**

**Established practice -
Identify features of the practice previously in use - this may include any aspects which were subsequently amended**

**The LMS advantage -
Describe the benefits of the addition or amendment of an element of the LMS, as experienced by learners, practitioners and/or the institution as a whole**

**Key points for effective practice -
Briefly identify the most important points in the case study for other practitioners â€“ these may include risks as well as benefits**

**Conclusions and recommendations -
A summary of how and why the practice etc., outlined here has been effective**

**Additional information -
Related materials or content if appropriate**

The following is a useful template if you are developing a prototype or similar as an output from your LMS project:

  * **Template for Final Progress Post** (please copy and paste the below into the html of your final post and fill out accordingly.  Delete comments inside of HTML ignore tags, e.g. "<!-- lorum ipsum doler -->"):
    * Screenshots or diagram of prototype: <!-- Please provide a series of screenshots or diagram that will quickly explain the point and process of your prototype to the end user.  Annotation on screenshots welcome, e.g. [see previous project examples](http://blogs.carnegiecollege.ac.uk/clipper/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ClipperDashHD2sized1.png)-->
    * Description of Prototype: <--! Please write this description for the end user so they can easily understand what the prototype is about and how to use it, please be brief and to the point (think Argos Catalogue like description). -->
    * End User of Prototype: <--! What end user do you think will want to use this prototype, please provide a expressive example that would engage this end user on why they want to use your prototype-->
    * Link to working prototype: <!-- This http link should point directly to a working prototype in which the end user can interact, if a working prototype is not available then please provide a screencast or series of screenshots demonstrating end user functionality, this screencast should not exceed 5 minutes.  Please note: working prototypes are preferred even if just 'rough and ready', please do not send powerpoints or other non web-based documents, they will not be accepted. This prototype must be maintained for one year after the date of the official project sign-off. -->
    * Link to end user documentation: <!-- Please provide an http link for a page that explains the use of the prototype to the end user, e.g. an "about" page that explains the project and why it is producing the prototype.  For example, what end user problem does it solve, what question does the prototype answer, what itch for the community does it scratch? -->
    * Link to code repository or API: <!-- This http link should be to the primary page listing all code libraries for the prototype.  This page must be maintained for one year after the official date of the project sign-off. -->
    * Link to technical documentation: <!-- Please provide an http link for a page listing all technical documentation which explains the code listed in the code repository above.  -->
    * Date prototype was launched: <!-- Please provide a date for when the last version of the prototype was made available to end users -->
    * Project Team Names, Emails and Organisations: <!-- For example: "David F. Flanders, d.flanders@jisc.ac.uk - Joint Information Systems Committee; etc."  -->
    * Project Website: <!-- HTTP link to any additional wiki, blog or site that has applicable documentation -->
    * PIMS entry: <!-- Please provide a link to your projects entry in PIMS, for example: https://pims.jisc.ac.uk/projects/view/1333 (ignore authentication pop-up) -->
    * Table of Content for Project Posts <!-- A final thematic table of contents should be provided here of all the project posts written along with links to each post.  Please make this table of contents generic to any readership that might find your project on the Web. -->
      * Required Tags for this Final Progress Post = "progressPosts", jiscLMS", "JISC", "finalProgressPost", "output", "prototype", "product", "demonstrator", "[yourUniqueProjectTag](yourUniqueProjectTag.md)", etc.
