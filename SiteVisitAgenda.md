# Why visit each project face-to-face? #

From the Programme Manager's point of view the site visit is the most significant time spent with projects as it gives a chance to find out what each individual project is excited and passionate about.  Why care about excitement and passion? - Because, these are the things that drive change and innovation (well that and a really good user-centric idea). This meeting is an opportunity to find out how and why your passion or excitement for a new way of doing things has been kindled.

## Setting up the site visit ##

### Preparation for a good site visit: ###
  * The site visit will take at least 3 hours (best if scheduled with lunch before or after the meeting so we can talk about something else other than shop).
  * If a whiteboard and/or flip chart could be available in the meeting room so that a common diagram of the project can be drawn up during the meeting.
  * As many of the project team members as possible should attend at some point (not everyone has to be there at the same time, but the Programme Manager has come all that way to see people face-to-face so please do schedule time with all team members accordingly), a tour around campus is nice as well - especially if there is the opportunity to see real users in the wild!
  * Please make sure to send directions on how to get to your building well in advance of the site visit (as with all good public sector staff your Programme Manager will be coming via public transport, i.e. train).
  * This is your one and only visit with your programme manager so do take advantage of this meeting, e.g. Programme Manager's are often the most well informed cross-sector person who can make additional resources available for your project.
  * This meeting is about you and your project so you should do most of the talking; ideally your Programme Manager should be asking questions and taking notes while you provide as much insight as possible!  Please Note: All of this data will help inform the JISC on future spending initiatives.

### Agenda for site visit: ###
(this is not a strict agenda and the meeting should be free-flow conversation, though all topics should be covered by the conclusion of the meeting).
  * Whose who (introductions):
    * Who is who and what is their background in relation to this project?
    * Which part of the project is each person responsible?
  * How does JISC work:
    * What does a JISC Programme Manager do?
    * What does it mean to be a JISC project?
  * What is the 'jiscLMS Programme':
    * How does your project fit within it?
    * What relations to other projects should you have?
    * What can you expect during the course of the programme in terms of support and wider dissemination of your project outputs?
  * What has been the history of this project?
    * How did it come about, what was the original seed idea for the project?
  * How would you currently describe the value of your project to a senior stakeholder?
    * What is the product this project is producing, e.g. if someone asked right now what 'thing' they could reuse from your project, what would it be?
    * Who is your primary audience you are thinking of when thinking about the output you are producing?
  * At the end of this project what is going to happen?
    * How will this project be re-funded or closed?
    * What other business models could this project take advantage of if successful?
    * How will staff be re-funded and what other concerns will they have as the funding comes to an end?
  * What further resources could JISC provide the project?
    * What addition skills do the project need?
    * Who could the project benefit speaking to for further guidance?

### Post site visit ###
After the site visit the Programme Manager has quite a few tasks they will follow-up on:
  * The Programme Manager will type up their notes and post them on this website (notifying the project and asking for any corrections)
  * Actions from the notes will be followed up.
  * The notes (once approved by the project) will be passed on to other JISC staff for guidance and/or potential networks.
  * Themes from all the project site visits will be collected and analysed to inform the Programme Meeting (where all project come together to share experiences)
