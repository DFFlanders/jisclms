# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Coventry University Primo Implementation Project
    * **Project Tag**: covprimo
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: Setting up and evaluating a new interface to provide a single point of access for all Library searches.
    * **long**: Coventry University Library is introducing a new interface (using Ex Libris’s Primo product) to provide a single point of access for all Library searches. This should provide a more consistent and intuitive user experience for Library users and improve the efficiency of information retrieval. It is also hoped that the new interface will increase the use of the Library’s e-resources, so giving better value for money. As part of the implementation a usability study will be carried out to inform changes to the core Primo product to make it as intuitive as possible.
    * **problem it solves?**:
