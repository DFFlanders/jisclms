    * **Project Tag**: yocalcat
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: Implementation and usability case study of OCLC WorldCat Local resource discovery interface at York St John University.
    * **long**: York St John University is implementing OCLC WorldCat Local as its resource discovery interface to the Library OPAC and federated searching.  The study will review the implementation of WorldCat Local, a subscription-based service, widely used in North America and beginning to be marketed in the UK and Europe.  A usability study will be perfomed using a variety of techniques, including personas, use cases, task analysis and interaction scenarios followed by heuristic evaluation and data analysis informed largely by the Critical Incident Technique.  A report will be produced detailing the technical implementation, the challenges faced by a small systems team, interoperability with the LIS OPAC and other systems, usability testing of the interface, future plans for developing the system and recommendations for the further development of such a resource discovery interface.
