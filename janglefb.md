# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: JANus – Jangle for Users of Sirsi
    * **Project Tag**: janglefb
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: >120 characters
    * **long**: The project will deliver a Jangle connector for the Sirsi Dynix Unicorn Library Management System along with a functioning Facebook application with Jangle based data integration. Documentation, installation and support materials for both will also be produced.  It will also produce a set of use cases which will be made openly accessible, and may be useful to others planning similar developments, e.g. with another LMS. The success criteria are: 1.) a functioning Jangle connector will be developed and will be available to, and usable by the JISC community, with appropriate documentation, and 2.) A Jangle enabled Application for the Facebook social networking site will also be available, for use by the community.
