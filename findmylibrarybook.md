# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Library Locator
    * **Project Tag**: findmylibrarybook
  * **Project Descriptions**
    * **short**: Shows you where to find the book you need on the shelves of LSE Library
    * **long**: The Library Locator (findmylibrarybook) is a Webservice that accepts a bibliographic reference (to a printed item held by a specific library), and returns information about and guidance to the physical storage location(s) of one or more copies of the item. In effect this is similar to the way that OpenURL resolvers, knowing about the e-resources holdings (subscriptions) of a specific library, can translate a bibliographic reference to a URL link to one or more sources of the full text of the item  - which should be accessible to (licensed for use by) patrons of that library. The Library Locator widget must be capable of embedding in various services that may contain such bibliographic references, including library catalogues, VLEs, reading lists.  The project also includes development of tools for maintenance of location data by library staff.
