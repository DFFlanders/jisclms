# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Exploring Open Source Viability
    * **Project Tag**: ossviab
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: Project to produce a detailed evaluation of functionality to UK requirements of the Open Source product 'Evergreen'
    * **long**: The project will  examine the Open Source Library Management System ‘Evergreen’ with a view to measurement of functionality against the standards as set out in the widely used ‘United Kingdom Core Specification’. In particular the project will concentrate on areas requiring future development of interest to UK libraries, such as the Serials, Acquisitions and Consortia support functions.  This will be undertaken via a combination of desk based research, use of a small ‘test’ installation of the Evergreen software, and engagement / site visits with the existing user & development communities in North America & Canada.  It is envisaged that completion of this resource will enable UK institutions to make an informed choice about the viability of implementing Evergreen in its current and near future states.
    * **problem it solves?**:
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    * a detailed report on the Evergreen system including a ‘functionality gap analysis’
    * supporting materials detailing site visits to current working versions of evergreen in Canada
