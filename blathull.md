# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Blacklight at Hull
    * **Project Tag**: blathull
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: This study investigates a more flexible discovery tool for Hull’s library catalogue and looks at extending it to local repository search.
    * **long**: This case study will examine the implementation of the open source Blacklight discovery interface system over the library catalogue at the University of Hull, which is currently delivered through the Millennium library management system from Innovative Interfaces.  Additionally, the use of the Blacklight interface to search across both library catalogue and institutional digital repository will be explored. The aim of the case study is to investigate an alternative and more flexible discovery interface to the library catalogue and understand the issues and benefits of extending this search to include local digital resources.
