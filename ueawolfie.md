# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Widgets for Open Library InfrastructurE
    * **Project Tag**: ueawolfie
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: Framework for deploying services (e.g. renew books) via Facebook, iGoogle, etc.
    * **long**: A framework for publishing services as standardised interfaces which can be accessed from social media 'widgets' eg. FaceBook.
Standard interfaces allow the same widgets to be reused against different library management systems, increasing portability between institutions.
The project includes implementations for Exlibris Aleph, and widgets for Facebook and iGoogle, but the longer term goal is to extend to additional services and widget platforms.
Ensuring security (securing services, linking social network accounts to institutional accounts etc) is a key technical challenge within the project.
    * **problem it solves?**:
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    * Software (Framework, Aleph implementation and widgets)
    * ?
